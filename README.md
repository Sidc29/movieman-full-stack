# Introduction

This project is a movie website built using React and Tailwind CSS, designed to provide a seamless movie browsing experience. Users can filter and display movies based on their preferences, with filter options including now playing, popular, top-rated, and upcoming movies. The website also features a search functionality that enables users to search for movies based on titles, actors, or genres.

The website uses an external movie API to provide users with access to a vast database of movies. This ensures that the website stays up-to-date with the latest movie releases, offering users a comprehensive selection of movies to explore.

The website is highly responsive and user-friendly, adapting to different screen sizes and device types, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. It also features a dark mode option that makes it easier to browse and watch movies in low-light conditions.
